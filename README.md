# 👋 Nice to see you!

My name is Shon Li. I am a third-year electrical and electronic engineering student at The Univerisity of Auckland. I like writing code and making nice things. My email is `hi@shon.li`.

Here are my two repositories.

### [晓航的博客 Shon's Blog](https://shon.li/)

I posted some words and photos there. You will see both Chinese Mandarin and English on the page.


### [Cash Calculator](https://shon.li/cc)

This is a webpage tool to count cash and finish calculating the turnover in a small retail shop.
