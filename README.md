# ðŸ‘‹ Nice to see you!

My name is Shon Li. I am a third-year electrical and electronic engineering student at The Univerisity of Auckland. I like writing code and making nice things. My email is `hi@shon.li`.

Here are my two repositories.

### [Cash Calculator](https://shon.li/cc)

This is a webpage tool to count cash and finish calculating the turnover in a small retail shop. I made it for a shop I once worked for.

### [Shon's Site](https://shon.li/readme.html)

This is the readme page of my website/blog. I posted some words and photos there. You will see both Chinese Mandarin and English on the page. I want to make it bilingual-friendly. Sorry if it looks too exotic to you.
I am proud to have built it from scratch using Jekyll. I like the simple and boring look I created. :)
